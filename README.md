# My MERN Stack Journey

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into full-stack development using the MERN stack. Guided by [Net Ninja's MERN Stack Tutorials](https://www.thenetninja.co.uk/), till now I have explored the foundational concepts of integrating **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**.

Through this journey, I am  developing a deeper understanding of how modern web applications are structured and how these technologies work together seamlessly.

## Why I Started Learning MERN

I’ve always been fascinated by how web applications are built and how data flows between the client and server. The MERN stack provides a cohesive way to learn full-stack development because of its reliance on JavaScript across all layers of the application. This helps in mastering modern web development.

## My Next Steps  

- Delve deeper into topics like authentication, advanced routing, and deployment.  
- Build a small project to solidify the concepts I've learned so far.  
- Continue with the next resources to enhance my understanding of MERN.
